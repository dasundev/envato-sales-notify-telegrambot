# envato-sales-notify-telegrambot
This is specifically designed for Envato authors to be notified via telegram when a new sale is received.

# Installation
- Clone **envato-sales-notify-telegrambot** into your server root location.
- Install [Telegram App](https://telegram.org/) in your device.
- Search ```@BotFather``` & click on ```/start```
- Then type ```/newbot``` & type a name for your bot then press enter.
- Copy paste your ```$telegramApiKey``` with your Telegrame Api Token.
- Paste the following link in your browser. Replace <API-access-token> with the API access token that you identified or created in the previous section:
  ```https://api.telegram.org/bot<API-access-token>/getUpdates?offset=0```
- Send a message to your bot in the Telegram application. The message text can be anything. Your chat history must include at least one message to get your chat ID.
- Refresh your browser.
- Identify the numerical chat ID by finding the id inside the chat JSON object. In the example below, the chat ID is ```123456789```

  ```
  {  
   "ok":true,
     "result":[  
        {

              },
              "date":1487183963,
              "text":"hi"
           }
        }
